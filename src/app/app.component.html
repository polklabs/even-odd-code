  <h1>Is It Even?</h1>

  <p>
    In the realm of programming, even the simplest of tasks can hold hidden
    complexities. Take, for instance, the humble task of determining whether a
    number is even or odd. While this might seem straightforward, there's often
    more than meets the eye.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's explore how to create a function that can efficiently determine
    whether a given integer is even or odd. But hold on tight, because unlike
    some other implementations, we're not just handling all 64-bit numbers.
    We're aiming for a solution that works for every integer!
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a function that works for every integer, we could start by
    manually checking each integer's parity through a series of if-else
    statements. While this approach may seem laborious to the uninitiated, it
    lays the groundwork for truly understanding the problem domain.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this approach, we meticulously inspect each integer up to a certain point
    and arrogantly proclaim its parity. No reliance on magical operators here;
    just good old-fashioned logic. We return true if it's even and false if it's
    odd. While this method may seem exhaustive to the feeble-minded, it prevents
    edge cases related to the intricacies of even and odd numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know you may be thinking, "What about the magical modulo operator?", to
    which you should think, "How do I know modulo works for all numbers?" Ah,
    the folly of blind reliance on mathematical abstractions. But fear not, for
    with each if-else statement, we forge our understanding, unbound by the
    shackles of uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, the next time you encounter a programming challenge, remember the
    lessons learned here. With patience and perseverance, you too can master the
    art of programming, one perfectly crafted statement at a time.
